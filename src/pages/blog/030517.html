            <h2>What is programming?</h2>

            <p>The act of writing a computer program.</p>


            <h1>Concepts</h1>

            <h2>Sequence</h2>

            <p>Sequence is the concept of a program going from start to finish in order, the program is executed in sequence. The sequence can contain any number of actions but the actions can't be skipped. They must be executed in the order they appear.</p>

            <h2>Selection</h2>

            <p>Selection is the concept of taking a course of action based on a question/answer scenario in the code. This structure is most commonly seen in the if-else if- else structure.</p>

            <h2>Repetition</h2>

            <p>Repetition is the concept of executing the same code any number of times. Repetition is seen in loops, executing the same code until a condition is true. Repetition is also seen in functions and procedures and their reuse throughout a program.</p>

            <h2>Modularisation</h2>

            <p>Modularisation is the concept of splitting the code into reuse-able blocks, also knows as functions and procedures. Making the code modular allows you to reuse common code instead of having it repeated all over the place. The resulting code is maintainable and smaller when Modularised.</p>


            <h1>Artefacts</h1>

            <h2>PROGRAM</h2>

            <p>A program is a collection of code that fulfills a purpose. For example a web browser's purpose is to load and view web pages.</p>

            <h2>FUNCTION</h2>

            <p>A section of code that takes input, manipulates it and then returns a result.</p>

            <h2>PROCEDURE</h2>

            <p>A section of code that executes and doesn't return a result.</p>

            <h2>COMMENT</h2>

            <p>Data in the program that isn't executed and is meant for documentation purposes. Like a note explaining what a section of code does.</p>

            <h2>VARIABLE</h2>

            <p>A variable is a value that can be changed.</p>

            <h2>CONSTANT</h2>

            <p>A constant is a value that can't be changed.</p>

            <h2>TYPE</h2>

            <p>A classification of data that tells the compiler how the information is intended to be used. Examples of data types are: Integer, Boolean, String and Float.</p>

            <h2>ARRAY</h2>

            <p>An array is a list of values that can be changed. Items in the array can be referenced by a numbered index, usually starting at '0'.</p>

            <h2>IF Statement</h2>

            <p>A conditional statement that executes code if a condition is true.</p>

            <h2>ELSE Statement</h2>

            <p>Execute code if the IF condition is false.</p>

            <h2>SWITCH Statement</h2>

            <p>A selection statement that executes code if a value matches another value inside the case.</p>

            <h2>WHILE/REPEAT Loop</h2>

            <p>A loop statement that repeatedly executes the code inside the statement until a condition is true.</p>

            <h2>FOR Loop</h2>

            <p>A loop statement that repeatedly executes the code inside the loop for a known number of times.</p>
