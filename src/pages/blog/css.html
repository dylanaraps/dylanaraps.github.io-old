            <h1>Why was Neofetch created?<p class="date">10/04/2017 - Shell - Dylan Araps</p></h1>

<p>Neofetch or as it was originally called <span class="code">fetch</span> was never meant to be a replacement for Screenfetch nor was it ever meant to display Ascii logos. Neofetch first started as my <span class="code">70</span> line hard-coded script that only supported Arch Linux, only displayed a tiny amount of info and only supported showing images with w3m-img.</p>

<p>I started posting screenshots of my system to <a href="https://reddit.com/r/unixporn">/r/unixporn</a> which included my tiny little script. People started using the script and started asking me to add support for their Linux Distros and later their Operating systems. Happy to see that others were using something that I created, I started adding support to various Distros and Operating systems.</p>

<p>When it came to adding support for Mac OS I realized that I had hit a stopping point. The script wasn't written in a way that would allow me to easily expand it to more Operating systems; it needed a rewrite. So I (re)wrote the script from scratch over an entire weekend and the result is the script base/structure that Neofetch is still using today.</p>

<p>I continued to work on Neofetch every day and whenever someone suggested a feature, I would add it no questions asked. One day a user by the name of <a href="https://github.com/aloisdg">@aloisdg</a> opened a bug report on the repo requesting "ascii art support". [1] I jumped on this and was shocked to see how easy it was to implement, I had a working version the same day and it was in master a day later.</p>

<p>As I continued working on Neofetch every day, looking for ways to improve it I decided to get it to feature parity with Screenfetch. Once Neofetch supported displaying the same info as Screenfetch I thought to myself; what else can we add to Neofetch?</p>

<p>I started adding new info functions, features, config options and Neofetch eventually supported displaying info like Current Terminal Emulator, Terminal Emulator Font, Device Model (Name of laptop, etc.) and much more.</p>

<p>I continue to work on Neofetch every day and I'm still looking for ways to extend it further. :-)</p>
