            <h1>Hi</h1>

            <p>I'm an ICT Student in my second year at Swinburne in Melbourne. This website is mainly up as a novelty right now, there's nothing really meaningful on here. My serious development projects can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps">here</a> or if you want to get in touch I'm reachable <a href="https://dylanaraps.com/pages/contact">here</a>. ciao</p>
